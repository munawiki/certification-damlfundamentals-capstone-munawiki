# üåç Carbon Credit Management System üåç

This system is designed to manage the issuance, transfer, consumption, and verification of carbon credits using Daml.

### I. Overview

The Carbon Credit Management System is built to facilitate the tracking and management of carbon credits. It supports various operations such as issuance, consumption, transfer, and verification of carbon credits. The system is built on Daml, showcasing the power of smart contracts in managing complex workflows and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

### II. Workflow

1. An issuer creates a `CarbonCreditIssuanceProposal` contract for a company.
2. The company reviews and accepts the proposal, resulting in the creation of a `CarbonCreditIssuance` contract.
3. The company can then consume credits through the `ConsumeCredits` choice or transfer credits to another party via the `TransferCredits` choice.
4. The receiving party can verify the details of the transferred credits using the `VerifyTransfer` choice.

### III. Key Features

- **Issuance of Carbon Credits**: Issuers can propose the creation of carbon credits for companies, specifying the amount and details.
- **Consumption of Carbon Credits**: Companies can consume a portion of their carbon credits as part of their carbon offset efforts.
- **Transfer of Carbon Credits**: Companies can transfer some of their carbon credits to other parties.
- **Verification of Carbon Credits**: The receiving party can verify the details of the transferred carbon credits.

### IV. Challenges and Solutions

- **Ensuring Compliance**: The system is designed to ensure that all operations comply with environmental regulations and standards.
- **Scalability**: Built on Daml, the system is scalable and can handle a large volume of transactions and operations efficiently.
- **Security and Transparency**: The use of smart contracts ensures that all operations are secure and transparent, providing trust among all parties involved.

### V. Compiling & Testing

To compile and test the Carbon Credit Management System, you can run the pre-written scripts in `Main.daml` and `CarbonCredit.daml` or use the following command:

```
$ daml start
```

This command compiles the Daml models and starts a local sandbox environment for testing.
